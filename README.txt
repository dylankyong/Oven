This lab involves the use of a state machine to perform the basic functions of an oven. These states include RESET, START, COUNTDOWN, PENDING_SELECTOR_CHANGE and PENDING_RESET. This oven is displayed on the oled screen and controlled using button 3 and button 4. There are three timers in this lab (100Hz, 5Hz and 2Hz). The 100Hz timer is used to check for button presses, the 5Hz timer is used for checking long presses and the 2Hz timer is used to check for the countdown clock. There are three modes: bake, toast and broil. Bake has a variable time and temperature. It uses both the top and bottom heater. Toast has a variable time, but no temperature is shown. It uses the bottom heater. Broil has a variable time and a set temperature of 500 degrees farhenheit. It uses the top heater. Button three (pressed for under 1 second) swaps the cooking mode. If it is pressed for longer than 1 second, it toggles between time and temperature mode. Pressing button 4 for under 1 second begins the cooking process. If held down for longer than one second in the process of cooking, it resets to the RESET state. The most important part of this lab is the communication between the Oled screen and the different states. The Oled needs to be able to interpret the oven variables and print out the correct corresponding information.

For this lab, I read the provided material on state machines until I had a firm understanding of how they functioned. I religiously followed the lab manual and I found that everything worked when I tested it. There weren't too many complications and I found that my initial method of completing the lab was satisfactory. I had a different set of timers that were similar to previous labs. These weren't the same as the one that Max talked about in lecture so I spent another 5-6 hours making them closer to the lab manual. This primarily revolved around the 2 Hz timer. I needed to double all the values and adjust my program to work with the new changes. I discussed various aspects of this lab with Shimon. We verbally presented issues that each of us had with our code and brainstormed ways to fix them. We also discussed the timers and how they were supposed to function.

The primary issue I had with this lab was clarity. I was unsure of various portions of the lab and how the instructors wanted the lab to be coded. My timers worked, but I wasn't using event markers. This was clarified over piazza and in lab section. The comments in the manual about only updating the Oled in certain situations was unclear to me as I found it nessessary to update consitently to get the correct print value on the Oled. I would say that for the most part the lab manual was a very excellent resource to assist in completing this lab.
